What is lrw:
  lrw is a tiny tool containing some useful commands which can be used to
  access hardware. for eaxmple get or set IO ports, PCI configurations... 
  
----------------

Using lrw:
  lrw has two modes: shell mode and command line mode;
  shell mode: Type lrw or lrw shell will enter this mode.Under this mode lrw
  will type a prefix ">" and then wait for you to input the command line. 
  After each command have been exectued it will return this state untill 
  you input "quit" to exit;

  command line mode: Under this mode, lrw will exit at once when the command
  you wanted is finished. Some comfortable traits provided by shell can be
  used. for example: using up arrow or down arrow to get the historical commands.
  Directly type "lrw cmd xx xx xx" will tell lrw to enter this mode.
